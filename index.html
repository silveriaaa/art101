					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>I am a fourth-year student at UCSC majoring in Sociology and Critical Race and Ethnic Studies. 
						I work on a beautiful farm, which is one of my favorite places at the moment. I love to do anything creative, I often jump hobbies to whatever I am interested in at the moment. 
						Some of my hobbies include knitting/crocheting, making stencils, jewelry-making, sewing, and gardeing. I also love to cook and eat!  </p>
