					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Use a text editor to edit our HTML file and create a CSS file to customize our webpage.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>In a collective effort, my partner and I worked together to try our best to understand the concepts. Personally, at first I was not too confident coming into the assignment, but once I made sense of the assignment I was really excited to adjust the design of my webpage.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>My partner and I were successful in editing our HTML and creating a CSS file.</p>
