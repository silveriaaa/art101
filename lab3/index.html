			<h1>Lab 3 File Structure & File Transfer- </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The point of the lab was to create a local file structure using a text editor, 
					add index.html files and upload to the server.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>While editing the index.html, I encountered some issues with completing the code, 
					especially adding the links to my other labs. To resolve this I looked on W3Schools.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, the assignment went really well. I was slightly worried I wouldn't be able to figure it out, 
					but once I understood, it was fun again.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>In result, I successfully completed the assignment to my best ability.</p>
